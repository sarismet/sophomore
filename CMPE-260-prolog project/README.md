The prolog project was designed to give you the result of the parameters you give.<br/>
There are some example in the project pdf that I added here you can check it before looking at the content of the code.<br/>
In order to run this code you can just double click and give the predicate with parameters or in linux you need to type
swipl -s pokemon.pl.
