this is a dynamic programming project.Let's think of a old fax machine which can understand only words that we gave.We calculate how many different meaning that a text can mean.

the text is aaaa
and old fax machine just know a and aa
then the text could be a a a a or aa aa or a aa a or aa a a or a a aa so we have five possibilities.

The text has no space we assume.
